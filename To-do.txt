To-do:
- categories (P)
- products
- privilege
- if delete self user, logout after delete
- when delete categories/roles that have products/users attach, catch exception, ask user if they want to delete the products/users along with it. If yes, delete products based
categories/users based roles.
- if add user when logged in, don't log in with added user account
- after registration, log in with registration account if there's no user logged in
- only admin can change role
- register default role is customer
- hardcode user 'admin' with admin role
- make hardcoded role only add when missing
- add nav for other pages
- figure out how to make error message in case of validation failed (try either HttpSession method based on register or make an error.jsp)
