To-do:
- make change password page

- logout
- privilege
- if delete self user, logout after delete
- when delete categories/roles that have products/users attach, catch exception, ask user if they want to delete the products/users along with it. If yes, delete products based
categories/users based roles.
- if add user when logged in, don't log in with added user account
- if no user, register page won't show user nav
- only admin can change role
- register default role is customer
- hardcode user 'admin' with admin role
